            <p class="paragraph">The only real ways to get gift cards is to either buy them, or earn them through completing surveys or playing games. So I gathered the best sites where you can complete tasks and get rewarded with gift cards of your choice.</p>

            <p class="reviewtext"> Fetch is one of the easiest apps out there for earning gift cards—no surveys, no hoops to jump through. Just scan your grocery and retail receipts, and you’ll earn points almost instantly. The process is seamless and surprisingly addictive. I love that you don’t have to buy specific brands to earn something, although there are bonus points for featured products. The points rack up faster than you’d expect, and they offer gift cards for everything from Amazon to Dunkin’. I usually save up for a bigger reward, but you can cash out with as little as 3,000 points. It’s a perfect passive way to get rewarded for purchases you already make.</p>

            <p class="reviewtext"> Salad AI offers an impressive variety of rewards, letting you claim Discord Nitro, full Minecraft accounts, Minecoins, and many other gift cards just by sharing your PC’s unused GPU power. The platform is designed for simplicity: you download the app, let it run when you’re idle, and earn credits toward your chosen rewards. The store is updated often, and rewards like Nitro or Minecoins are delivered instantly and work flawlessly. Even with a mid-tier graphics card, you can earn enough for digital perks in just a few days. The app itself is clean, secure, and easy to set up, with no risk to your personal files. While running it does use extra electricity and your hardware, it’s a smart way to make your PC work for you when you’re not gaming. For gamers and digital enthusiasts alike, Salad is a unique way to earn what you love without spending cash.</p>

            <p class="reviewtext"> Idle-Empire is a hidden gem in the survey and task-reward space. It’s ideal for people who like to earn passively—watch videos, let some idle tasks run, or complete basic surveys. The interface is straightforward and user-friendly, with plenty of payout options including Amazon and other popular gift cards. What I really appreciate is how transparent the platform is with point values and requirements. There's even a loyalty bonus for active users. While it’s not as flashy as some competitors, Idle-Empire feels stable and dependable. If you like to multitask or earn while doing other things, this site can help you stack up gift cards with minimal effort.</p>

            <p class="reviewtext"> Swagbucks is one of the most popular survey platforms around, and for good reason. You can earn points (called SB) for taking surveys, watching videos, or even shopping online. What I love most is how easy it is to rack up points during downtime. Most surveys take less than 10 minutes, and you can cash out for a wide variety of gift cards including Amazon, Target, and Starbucks. The dashboard is user-friendly and the surveys are generally straightforward. It won’t make you rich, but if you're consistent, you can easily earn a $5–$10 gift card each week. Highly recommended for anyone looking to earn rewards in their spare time.</p>

            <img src="https://www.inboxdollars.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/main-1.jpg" class="reviewimage">
            <p class="reviewtext"> InboxDollars has a clean, simple interface that makes taking surveys feel less like a chore. You earn actual cash instead of points, which is refreshing. While some surveys are longer and can be disqualified midway, I’ve found plenty that pay decently for the time. The best part? They offer gift cards for Amazon, Walmart, and more, and even a $5 bonus just for signing up. If you like taking surveys and watching videos while multitasking, this one’s for you. Just remember to check your email—they often send exclusive surveys that pay more than usual.</p>

            <img src="https://d29q07j9kpjtt3.cloudfront.net/assets/visitors/img/Logo-dark@2x.png" class="reviewimage">
            <p class="reviewtext"> Branded Surveys feels more professional than many other platforms. After a short profile setup, you start receiving personalized surveys, which means fewer disqualifications. They offer a solid range of gift cards from retailers like Amazon, Lowe’s, and Best Buy. One of the best features is their loyalty program—completing surveys consistently boosts your earnings over time. I especially appreciate how quick the payout process is. I’ve received Amazon gift cards within 48 hours of redeeming. If you’re looking for a reliable, no-fuss survey site, Branded Surveys is definitely worth trying.</p>

            <p class="reviewtext"> LifePoints is a great survey site if you're looking for quick and easy ways to earn gift cards. The surveys are well-organized and don’t feel repetitive, which is a big plus. Most of them only take 5 to 15 minutes to complete. They offer a variety of rewards including Amazon, PayPal, and retail gift cards. What I like most is the point tracking system—it’s simple and transparent. While it’s not the fastest way to earn, it’s consistent. If you check in regularly and complete available surveys, you can snag a decent amount of gift cards every month.</p>

            <img src="https://www.insightplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Toluna-Logo-Square-Insight-Platforms-1.png" class="reviewimage">
            <p class="reviewtext"> Toluna Influencers has a unique vibe—it feels more like a community than just a survey site. You can earn points by taking surveys, participating in polls, and even creating your own content. The surveys are often fun and more interactive than other sites. The reward catalog is impressive, offering gift cards to stores like Sephora, Amazon, and even Netflix. It takes a little time to accumulate enough points for a reward, but the experience itself is enjoyable. If you’re into more than just surveys and enjoy being part of an opinion-sharing community, Toluna is a solid pick.</p>
